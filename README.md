This project was an assignment for UCLA's graduate course: CS259 -- Learning Machines. 
The goal is to design and implement convolution and classification kernels in CUDA that improve on a CPU baseline (see [DianNao](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2541940.2541967)). 
We also compare our custom CUDA implementation with results obtained by running 
[Baidu's DeepBench](https://github.com/baidu-research/DeepBench) which leverages cuDNN acceleration.
